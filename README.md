**requestr** is an HTTP request library, made for exploit writing. It seeks to simplify HTTP requests in Golang by 
eliminating boilerplate code. 

As a goal for myself, I set out to work towards the OSWE certification completely in Golang (because I loved it that 
much). However, it made me realise how overly verbose making requests in Golang was, and so this package was born.

It is currently still a WIP, and requires much more refactoring and abstractions for it to become what I envision it 
should be.
